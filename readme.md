# ðŸ’¼ Employee Salary Predictor (Streamlit + Machine Learning)

This project predicts the **salary** of an employee based on their academic rank, discipline, gender, and years of experience â€” using a machine learning model built with **Random Forest Regressor** and a real-world dataset.

Itâ€™s a single `.py` file built for simplicity, submission, and demonstration â€” with **Streamlit** used for a clean web-based interface.
